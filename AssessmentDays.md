Assessment days
===============

Who is responsible for inviting candidates for assessment days?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Talent team, in our case Kate.

Who is responsible for sending out the task?
--------------------------------------------
The hiring manager, in our case Maro.
The week before the assessment days, the h.m. consults with the team what a good task is.
The task is sent out the calendar day before the assessment days start.
The standard email is:

    Welcome to Prezi assessment days!
    These days are about getting know each other.
    We want to see if you're as good as we think you are.
    Hopefully you'll think Prezi is amazing.

    # outcome
    At the end of the 3 days you will be asked:
    "How much you would you like to work at prezi? Rate your experience from 1 to 10."
    At the same time, I will ask other D.A.T.A. members:
    "How much you would like to work with X, 1 to 10?"

    # assignment
    XXXXX

    Your mentor: XXXXX
    XXX knows everything, she will be here Monday 9AM.

    # concerns
    We design assessment days to address our concerns we have with candidates.
    Note that we always have concerns with candidates.
    Our concern with you:
    Can you work with a wide variety of people to gather required background information, work with our constantly changing infrastructure and get a complex/messy project not just done, but done done?

    # chemistry
    Your assignment for the 3 days is not 100% clear.
    It's a high ambiguity situation on purpose.
    There is a chance that you won't be able to finish it.
    You will have to go talk to people and ask them for help.
    Ask for support, ideas, direction, conventions, and so forth.
    Don't be shy, all of the people around you have been in the same situation.
    Assessment days are also about chemistry.
    We'll be concerned with how many questions do you ask: too many? not enough?
    How ambitious you are, how quickly you solve problems, etc.
    Candidates tend to care about the people, tools, organization, and intangible things like mood, culture, atmosphere.
    Most importantly, you get to see how do we get shit done, or how we don't.
    Maybe that's why we're thinking of hiring you.

    # mentors
    During the assessment days a mentor will be assigned to you.
    Your mentor's job is to help you to be successful.
    You can ask your mentor whatever you want.
    Don't hesitate to ask, ever.
    Three days are short and not asking increases the chances of it being wasted time.
    An assessment period is hard, but mentors can answer questions, and if they can't they know who can.
    S/he's there to tell you about club mate, convince you to go to prezi club events, have lunch with you, and keep track of your progress as well as help you find the people around you that can make you even more effective.
    You can think of him/her as a social/productivity helper for these 3 days.
    You will also be pointed in the direction of experts who you should consult during your assessment.
    Use their knowledge.

    # teams
    Your assessment task may not be associated with the teams you would most likely join if you were to work for Prezi.
    Please learn about all the current teams at Prezi during the assessment.
    You can interview the members of all the teams you like (but don't forget we have recruitment priorities).

    # conclusion prezi
    Explain to everyone what you were working on and what you have achieved.
    Please ask if anything is missing.
    Everybody is here to help you.
    Scheduled for Wednesday, check your calendar.

    # hiring manager = maro
    Let's have a quick chat every day about your progress.
    I will schedule a quick meet with you on Monday and Tuesday.

    Good luck :)

1v1s during the assessment days
-------------------------------
The hiring manager sets up a 1v1 on the end of the 1st and 2nd day with the candidate.
Among others, he asks: "how much would you like in Prezi, on a scale of 1-10".

Preparing for the conclusion prezi
----------------------------------
At the end of the 2nd day, the hiring manager send out this email to the candidate:

    # about the assmt task
    - what was your assmt task?
    - what did you do?
    - if you were the techlead, how would you plan the remainder of this task?
    (don't draw in the prezi, if you want to draw there will be a whiteboard)

    # meta
    - what was the most surprising thing at Prezi for you?

    # the point of the whole thing
    - why should we hire you, why are you the right fit for the job?

Conclusion prezi
----------------
Talent sets up the conclusion Prezi.
Attendees:
- candidate
- every D.A.T.A. member
- talent: usually Kate and Christopher

Decision
--------
After the conclusion prezi, we ask the candidate to leave the room.
We discuss how it went.
The hiring manager asks everybody:
"How much would you like to work with the candidate, from 1-10?"
We make a decision on the spot whether to hire.
If it's a 'no', the hiring manager tells the candidate.
If it's a 'yes', the hiring manager consults first with Talent about levels and salaries, then makes the offer.
