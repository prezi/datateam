Assessment days
===============

Candidate persona
-----------------
When hiring starts, we write a Candidate persona Google doc.
We maintain it during the whole hiring process.
The hiring manager is responsible for this, and only the h.m. updates this doc.
We accept we won't find this exact person, but it helps us to be on the same page, when making yes/no decisions.

We write the candidate persona for a team that we are hiring for (eg. Data Service).
But we are gatekeepers: the person could 2 months later move to another team within D.A.T.A. or even PaaS.
Remember this when answering the question: "how much do you want to work with X?".

Every monday during D.A.T.A. lovefest we review the persona to make sure everybody is aware of any changes.

Inviting candidates
-------------------
Talent team, in our case Kate invites candidates to assessment days.

Kate has to make sure at least 75% of the team is here during those 3 days.

Assessment task
---------------
The week before the assessment days, the h.m., the mentor and the hiring team have a 30 minute meeting to finalize the assessment task.

Everybody has to bring ideas.

Task should:
- be a stretch (it should be a 2 week task where it's possible to have a good first step)
- address our concerns
- include relevant activities (eg. writing python code, talking to Kalman, making decisions)
- be matched to the estimated level

We have to discuss a roadmap, like this is what I would do, then that, this is how far I would get in 3 days. If he doesn't do that by the end of the 1st day, we do that, etc.

At the end of the meeting, the h.m. decides what the task is.

Work during assessment days
---------------------------
During assessment days, everybody (D.A.T.A. and candidate) sit together in the ballroom.
Try to avoid work-from-home during assessment days.
This is important, so:
- the candidate can ask questions to clarify the task
- the candidate can learn about the team, to make an informed decision at the end
- D.A.T.A. can learn about the candidate, to make an informed decision at the end

Sending out the assessment task
-------------------------------
The hiring manager, in our case Maro sends out the assessment task.
The week before the assessment days, the h.m. consults with the team what a good task is.
The task is sent out the calendar day before the assessment days start to the candidate's private email.
The standard email is:

    Welcome to Prezi assessment days!
    These days are about getting know each other.
    We want to see if you're as good as we think you are.
    Hopefully you'll think Prezi is amazing.

    # outcome
    At the end of the 3 days you will be asked:
    "How much you would you like to work at prezi? Rate your experience from 1 to 10."
    At the same time, I will ask other D.A.T.A. members:
    "How much you would like to work with X, 1 to 10?"

    # assignment
    XXXXX

    Your mentor: XXXXX
    XXX knows everything, she will be here Monday 9AM.

    # concerns
    We design assessment days to address our concerns we have with candidates.
    Note that we always have concerns with candidates.
    Our concern with you:
    Can you work with a wide variety of people to gather required background information, work with our constantly changing infrastructure and get a complex/messy project not just done, but done done?

    # chemistry
    Your assignment for the 3 days is not 100% clear.
    It's a high ambiguity situation on purpose.
    There is a chance that you won't be able to finish it.
    You will have to go talk to people and ask them for help.
    Ask for support, ideas, direction, conventions, and so forth.
    Don't be shy, all of the people around you have been in the same situation.
    Assessment days are also about chemistry.
    We'll be concerned with how many questions do you ask: too many? not enough?
    How ambitious you are, how quickly you solve problems, etc.
    Candidates tend to care about the people, tools, organization, and intangible things like mood, culture, atmosphere.
    Most importantly, you get to see how do we get shit done, or how we don't.
    Maybe that's why we're thinking of hiring you.

    # mentors
    During the assessment days a mentor will be assigned to you.
    Your mentor's job is to help you to be successful.
    You can ask your mentor whatever you want.
    Don't hesitate to ask, ever.
    Three days are short and not asking increases the chances of it being wasted time.
    An assessment period is hard, but mentors can answer questions, and if they can't they know who can.
    S/he's there to tell you about club mate, convince you to go to prezi club events, have lunch with you, and keep track of your progress as well as help you find the people around you that can make you even more effective.
    You can think of him/her as a social/productivity helper for these 3 days.
    You will also be pointed in the direction of experts who you should consult during your assessment.
    Use their knowledge.

    # teams
    Your assessment task may not be associated with the teams you would most likely join if you were to work for Prezi.
    Please learn about all the current teams at Prezi during the assessment.
    You can interview the members of all the teams you like (but don't forget we have recruitment priorities).

    # conclusion prezi
    Explain to everyone what you were working on and what you have achieved.
    Please ask if anything is missing.
    Everybody is here to help you.
    Scheduled for Wednesday, check your calendar.

    # hiring manager = maro
    Let's have a quick chat every day about your progress.
    I will schedule a quick meet with you on XXXXX and XXXXX.

    Good luck :)

Mentor
------
Every candidate has a mentor.
The h.m. picks the mentor.
A mentor's responsibilities are:
- prepare for assessment task by figuring out how you would solve it
- make sure the candidate has a good time at Prezi, show him around, guide him
- help him set up the assessment Macbook
- make sure the candidate understands the task, help him scope
- but don't make decisions for him, don't solve big problems
- give minor programming help like you would to a teammate, help with code reviews
- give feedback to the candidate at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd day
- organize interesting lunch for candidate every day during assessment
- organize small databeer on 2nd day in Apacuka, 18:00 - 20:00
- review code before conclusion prezi

1v1s during the assessment days
-------------------------------
The h.m. sets up a 1v1 on the end of the 1st and 2nd day with the candidate.
Among others, he asks: "How much would you like to work in Prezi, on a scale of 1-10?"

Communication
-------------
At the end of the 1st and 2nd day, we discuss per email how the candidate is doing.
The mentor gives feedback to the candidate at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd day, guides him.

Preparing for the conclusion prezi
----------------------------------
At the end of the 2nd day, the h.m. sends out this email to the candidate:

    # about the assmt task
    - what was your assmt task?
    - what did you do?
    - if you were the techlead, how would you plan the remainder of this task?
    (don't draw in the prezi, if you want to draw there will be a whiteboard)
    
    # meta
    - what was the most surprising thing at Prezi for you?
    
    # the point of the whole thing
    - why should we hire you, why are you the right fit for the job?

Conclusion prezi
----------------
Talent team, in our case Kate sets up the conclusion Prezi in Google calendar.
Attendees:
- candidate
- every D.A.T.A. member
- talent team: usually Kate and Christopher

Decision
--------
After the conclusion prezi, we ask the candidate to leave the room.
We discuss how it went.
Ask yourself, "if you were the h.m., would you proudly announce this person during SnT?".
The hiring manager asks everybody:
- write 3 pros, 3 cons for the candidate
- how much would you like to work with the candidate, from 1-10?
We make a decision on the spot whether to hire.
If it's a 'no', the hiring manager tells the candidate.
If it's a 'yes', the hiring manager consults first with Talent about levels and salaries, then makes the offer.

Offer letter
------------
Talent team sends out an official offer the same day to the candidate.
The candidate has a few days to officially reply.
In either case, the h.m. lets D.A.T.A. know how it went, what level the candidate was hired at.
