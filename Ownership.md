What it means to own a system X
===============================

Being communicative
-------------------

You’ll get a lot of pressure from the team to deliver your work on time, as they’ll be dependent on it. You may also get a lot of pressure from the outside. I want to see you remain communicative and open, rather than shutting down and writing code without talking to anyone.
When shit hits the fan, I want to see you calm and raising a flag. If you spot new risks or making a risky change, I want to be kept part of the loop. It’s perfectly okay to say "no", it’s okay to notify the team or myself if there is a delay, just stay communicative.

Being active
------------
True ownership means that you’re driving the car. I want to see you gathering risks, requirements and feedback. I want to see you making sure everyone understands how to use the system and how to change it. I would like to see ideas and initiatives come from you. If you need time to deal with technical debt, I want you to ask for that.

Being aware
-----------

Decisions and priorities are always set in a given context. I want to see you explain the reasons behind a given priority or time estimation. I’m not looking for a perfect answer, but I do want to understand the context and reasoning you had while making the call. If you’re lacking context or priorities from me, I expect you to come and ask for it.

Tasks
-----
- conducting design reviews for every critical part of the system
- tracking requirements as part of our backlog (including rough estimation and priorities)
- tracking quality (bugs) and technical Debt
- writing documentation about how to use the infrastructure ("best practices") and how does it work under the hood (architecture decisions, basic flows etc.)
- sharing knowledge
- conducting code-reviews
- training at least one more teammate to co-pilot in your absence
- defining and monitoring our infrastructure’s metrics: up- time, response time, hits/second, health checks etc.
