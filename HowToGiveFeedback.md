How to give feedback
====================

**When you...  
I feel... because...  
I want... because...  
What do  you think?**

Tips for using the Constructive Feedback Model:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Start at the top and share with the person their behavior by saying, "When you ____." Fill in the blank with an actual behavior. Do not put in a character issue, an identity or something to nonspecific like, "when you are an idiot" or "when you act abusively." Behaviors are easier to change than character. A good example would be, "When you hit me on the chest" or "when you said that I should quit my job. . ." This is specific and helps build a bridge with the other person.
2. Then state how you feel. Put an emotion in the blank, like "sad," "mad," "upset," "left out," "scared," or some other emotion. "I feel that. . ." is an opinion, not a feeling. "I feel that you are trying to make my life difficult," is judging a person’s motive and is an opinion. "I feel" and "when you" are interchangeable. You can say, "I feel . . . when you. . ." or "When you. . ., I feel. . ."
3. "Because. . ." is option. It give the listener more information that may be necessary. For instance, "when you brought me yellow roses, I felt sad, because yellow means only friendship and red is for lovers." It clarifies. Without it might not make sense.
4. Specify what you want. Make is clear and simple. Use a because statement if necessary. 
5. Conclude with "what do you think." We are not asked this as much as we should. This includes the other person and asks them for feedback. It is really disarming to use after  we have share how we feel.
6. Practice makes perfect. Using this will better your communication. You can stop 
anywhere along the pyramid working your way down. 


Examples: 
- "When you raise your voice at me, I feel scared, because my dad always yelled at me." 
- "When you spend money on items I think we don’t need, I feel nervous, because we don’t have much money to spend."
