Flow efficiency vs resource efficiency
--------------------------------------
You have a process in which you serve a request or build something.
Let's say you are serving requests, like the Analytics team serves project requests.
A flow unit is a project.
A resource are the analysts working on the project.
Flow is the system which the unit and the resource make up:
- analyst talks to PMs, takes requests
- prioritizes requests
- decides what to do, what not to do
- communicates 'no' decisions
- works on projects
- iterates with PM on the project
- delivers result
- receives acknowledgement that the project is done from the PM

**Resource efficiency** is when the resource (the analyst) is always busy.
We often think that if we are resource efficient (always busy), we are efficient.
This is not true.

**Flow efficiency** means that the throughput time (the time it takes for a flow unit to go through the system) is low.
We should be optimizing for flow efficiency, not resource efficiency.
Why? Because this is what makes the customer (the PM) happy: if he receives his answer quickly. He doesn't care how hard the analyst works, how busy the analyst is.
